# Real-Time Quiz Game Backend

# Introduction -
A real-time quiz game app where two players compete against each other. Each player is presented with the same 4 questions in sequence, and they answer these questions independently. The player who scores the highest out of the 4 questions wins the game. The game needs to handle user authentication, real-time question delivery, answer validation, scoring, and state management.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: NodeJS
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSockets
- **Authentication**: JWT for user authentication


## Requirements

1. **User Authentication**:
    - Implement endpoints for user registration and login
    - Securely hash passwords before storing them in MongoDB
2. **Game Session Setup:**
    - Create an endpoint to start a new game session and match two players
    - Once matched, initiate a game session and notify both players using socket [**`game:init`**]
3. **Question Management**:
    - Pre-store a set of 4 questions in MongoDB. Each question should have a question text, multiple choices, and a correct answer
4. **Real-Time Question Delivery**:
    - Use socket to send questions to each player as soon as they are ready to receive the next question [`question:send`]
5. **Answer Submission and Scoring**:
    - Allow players to submit their answers through socket [`answer:submit`]
6. **Result Calculation**:
    - At the end of the 4 questions, calculate the final scores and determine the winner
    - Send the result to both players and store the session results in MongoDB. [`game:end`]
7. **API Endpoints**:
    - **`POST /register`**: Registers a new user.
    - **`POST /login`**: Authenticates a user.
    - **`POST /game/start`**: Starts a new game session.


It supports **user authentication, game sessions, real-time quiz handling, and scoring.**
